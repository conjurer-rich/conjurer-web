## Recognize the Challenge

In many organizations, project teams operate in silos, with responsibilities fragmented across different phases of a project. This division often necessitates frequent handovers between teams, leading to significant challenges:

- Lost information: Critical details can slip through the cracks during transitions.
- Delayed deliverables: Each handover introduces potential delays as new teams ramp up.
- Increased complexity: Multiple handovers complicate communication and accountability.

At Conjurer, we understand that these handovers are more than just logistical challenges‚Äîthey are opportunities for transformation.

## üîé Sense It: Identifying handover hurdles

Start by observing the points at which projects transition from one team to another. Note any recurring issues, such as delayed timelines or errors arising post-handover. Recognizing these patterns is the first step toward a more streamlined process.

## üó£Ô∏è Share It: Open dialogue for improvement

Encourage teams to share their experiences and challenges with handovers. Create forums or workshops where employees can discuss these issues openly and without judgment. This shared understanding is crucial for collective problem-solving.

## ü§ù Solve It: Building seamless transitions

- Integrate teams: Where possible, restructure teams to handle projects from inception to completion, reducing the need for handovers.
- Enhance skills: Train teams to develop a broader range of skills, enabling them to manage multiple stages of a project.
- Improve Tools: Implement project management tools that provide visibility across all stages, ensuring that every team member can track progress and understand their role in the bigger picture.
