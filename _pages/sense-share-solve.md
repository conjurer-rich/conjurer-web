## What is Sense It, Share It, Solve It?

The **Sense It, Share It, Solve It** framework is a structured process designed to:

- **Sense It**: Recognize subtle or obvious signals that something isn’t flowing as smoothly as it should. These might be awkward interactions, recurring delays, or unspoken frustrations.
- **Share It**: Foster open and transparent communication by visualizing and discussing challenges. Use proven techniques to explore the underlying root causes of the issues.
- **Solve It**: Collaboratively develop and implement solutions that reduce cognitive load, minimize dependencies, and streamline workflows.
