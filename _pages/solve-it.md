The **Solve It** phase of the **Sense It, Share It, Solve It** framework is where meaningful change happens. After recognizing and discussing blockers, this phase focuses on collaboratively implementing solutions that minimize dependencies, optimize workflows, and ensure the smooth flow of value across teams.

## What Does It Mean to "Solve It"?

Solving isn’t just about fixing immediate problems—it’s about addressing the root causes of inefficiencies and designing sustainable solutions. Key aspects of this phase include:

- **Reducing Dependencies**: Minimize the need for coordination between teams to accelerate the flow of work.
- **Optimizing Team Boundaries**: Redefine responsibilities to ensure clear ownership and accountability.
- **Ensuring Sustainability**: Implement solutions that not only address the current challenges but also improve long-term adaptability and efficiency.

## Tools and Techniques for Solving Blockers

Use these tools and strategies to implement impactful changes:

- **Team Interaction Modeling**: Leverage the insights gained during the "Share It" phase to redesign team interactions, creating clearer boundaries and reducing handovers.
- **Independent Service Heuristics**: Ensure teams have the autonomy they need to deliver value without relying on constant coordination with others.
- **Experimentation and Feedback Loops**: Implement changes incrementally, measure their impact, and adjust based on feedback to ensure solutions are effective.
- **Cross-Team Workshops**: Facilitate collaborative sessions where teams co-create solutions to shared challenges, fostering alignment and commitment.

## Example in Action

### Scenario

A project team frequently experiences delays due to dependencies on another team for key approvals.

### Solve It Approach

1. **Reduce Dependencies**: The teams collaborate to redefine their boundaries, enabling the project team to handle most approvals autonomously.
2. **Optimize Workflows**: Processes are streamlined, removing unnecessary steps that previously required coordination.
3. **Test and Adjust**: The changes are implemented on a trial basis, with regular feedback loops to refine and optimize further.

The result is faster delivery, reduced frustration, and a more efficient flow of value.

## Why Solve It Matters

Addressing root causes is essential for driving real change. By implementing solutions collaboratively, teams can:

- **Improve Flow**: Work progresses faster with fewer bottlenecks and interruptions.
- **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Clearer ownership and boundaries mean less stress and confusion for teams.
- **Enhance Collaboration**: Solutions created together are more likely to be embraced and sustained.
