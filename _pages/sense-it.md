# Sense It: Recognize Blockers to Flow

The **Sense It** phase is the first step in the **Sense It, Share It, Solve It** framework. It’s about becoming attuned to the subtle and not-so-subtle signals that indicate something isn’t working as it should. These signals can take many forms, from recurring delays to awkward team interactions. By sharpening your ability to sense these issues, you can identify opportunities for improvement before they escalate into bigger problems.

## What Does It Mean to "Sense It"?

Sensing is about more than just observing; it’s about actively identifying signals that something is impacting the flow of value in your organization. These signals might include:

- **Awkward Interactions**: Hesitation, miscommunication, or visible frustration during team meetings.
- **Recurring Delays**: Tasks taking longer than expected due to unclear responsibilities or dependencies.
- **Overcomplicated Processes**: Workflows with unnecessary steps or redundant approvals that slow progress.
- **Dependency Bottlenecks**: Teams or individuals waiting on others to complete tasks before they can proceed.
- **Team Misalignments**: Confusion over ownership boundaries or responsibilities within or between teams.

## Tools and Techniques for Sensing Blockers

The following methods can help you sharpen your ability to sense inefficiencies and blockers:

- **Observation During Stand-Ups**: Pay attention to recurring themes like delays, dependency complaints, or awkward pauses when discussing responsibilities.
- **Value Stream Mapping**: Visualize your workflow to identify bottlenecks and steps that don’t add value.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Encourage team members to share their experiences and frustrations through retrospectives, anonymous surveys, or direct feedback.
- **Workflow Analytics**: Use tools that provide data on cycle time, lead time, and other metrics to uncover hidden inefficiencies.
- **Dependency Tracking**: Create visualizations of team dependencies to see where work frequently stalls or creates bottlenecks.

## Why Sense It Matters

By improving your ability to sense blockers to flow, you enable your organization to:

- **Prevent Escalation**: Address issues early, before they grow into major inefficiencies.
- **Empower Teams**: Foster a proactive mindset, encouraging teams to identify and resolve problems.
- **Enhance Communication**: Create a culture of openness where concerns are discussed constructively.

## What's Next?

Once you’ve identified the signals of inefficiencies, the next step is to **[Share It](/sense-share-solve/share-it/)**. This involves communicating your observations effectively, using tools like team interaction modeling and value stream mapping to ensure a shared understanding of the problem.
