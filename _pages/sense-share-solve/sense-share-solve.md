## What is 🔍 Sense It, 🗣 Share It, 🤝 Solve It?

The **Sense It, Share It, Solve It** approach is designed to:

- Recognize subtle or obvious signals that something isn’t flowing as smoothly as it should. These might be awkward interactions, recurring delays, or unspoken frustrations.
- Foster open and transparent communication by visualizing and discussing challenges. Use proven techniques to explore the underlying root causes of the issues.
- Collaboratively develop and implement solutions that reduce cognitive load, minimize dependencies, and streamline workflows.

## Explore Each Phase

Dive deeper into each stage of the approach to learn how to apply it effectively in your team or organization:

- [**🔍 Sense It**](/sense-share-solve/sense-it): Learn how to detect the signals of inefficiency, such as delays, unclear responsibilities, or awkward team interactions. Discover tools and strategies to sharpen your observation skills.
- [**🗣 Share It**](/sense-share-solve/share-it): Understand how to visualize and communicate these challenges using techniques like team interaction modeling, user needs mapping, and independent service heuristics.
- [**🤝 Solve It**](/sense-share-solve/solve-it): Discover methods to reduce dependencies, optimize team boundaries, and implement sustainable solutions that drive faster flow and better outcomes.
